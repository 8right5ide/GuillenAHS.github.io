      <h3>The Basics of fighting</h3>
<img src="images/combined.jpg" width="259" height="194" alt=""/>
      <p>Learning how to play Smash Bros is relatively easy, all the basic moves are performed by pressing a single button, and some moves may need additional stick movement for more special attacks. Movement shouldn't be a problem, you can move left and right, down. Running is also easy, just slam the stick to the left or right, it'll come in handy when coming close to an enemy to use a smash attack. Jumping can be performed by pressing the "X" or "Y" buttons. To perform a neutral attack, press the "A" button, to perform a different attack tilt the stick either up, down, left, or, right. Neutral attacks are good for chipping damage from your opponent, other characters like Meta Knight can deliver a flurry of attacks by spamming the attack button, which will rapidly increase damage by a lot. </p>

      <h3>The Way around the controller</h3>
      <img src="images/knife.jfif" width="343" height="147" alt=""/>
<p>You know what's better than using basic attacks, using special attacks. The "B" button is used just for this purpose. Each character has its own unique move set and can deliver more damage but at the cost of speed. Just like with neutral attacks, moving the right stick while pressing "B" will change the attacks too. From neutral-smash to side, up, and down-special. For some characters like the pokemon trainer, their down-special isn't an attack instead, it switches out three available pokemon. Possibly the most important move you will use in a match is smash attacks, there the moves you use to knock your opponent off the stage. There are a few ways to perform a smash attack. The first is using the right stick and moving it in the direction of the attack. It will deliver a speedy version of the attack, but not at its full power. To activate its full power hold down the "A" button while moving the left stick in one direction. Shielding can be really useful when blocking enemy attacks. To use it, press the ZL or ZR triggers. The downside to using it is the shield takes damage over time. When it runs out, it leaves you left open to attacks from enemies. Grabbing opponents is a good way to counter another player's shield. Just press the L or R trigger to grab them and tilt the left stick to throw them. It will move and damage them. Dodging can help you stay in a fight. Press ZR and move the left or right stick. Use this to avoid big attacks. If you find yourself being knocked off the stage and falling down, to save yourself, use your up-special it will launch your character upwards. There are a few exceptions with other characters like Ness, his up-special fires a lightning ball you can direct towards him to launch him back to the ledge. </p>
