      <p>Carlos Guillen, 10/7/2022 After gaming for a long period of time, what feels tired? When playing for a long period of time, it's usually my eyes and my thumbs that feel tired. It's because 1 I'm staring at a bright screen for a long time and 2 since I play on consoles, I move my fingers to awkward positions. To fix this I can start taking short breaks between matches by staring at something else or blinking fast and stretching my fingers after a round to keep them flexable.</p>
      <p>What is this article about
The entire basis of this website is to show me, a budding gamer, exercises that will help stretch the muscles in my hands and wrists and also it'll help prevent pain in the wrists.</p>
      <p>Play one game for 30 minutes
After playing for 30 minutes, I noticed that my eyes feel tired and weak, probably due to me staring at the screen for a while. My neck also aches a bit, due to me looking down onto my switch.</p>
      <p>Several things I can take from this video are if you don't regularly exercise your body after a long while with typing are gaming, your body can develop posture issues. Another thing I can take away from this video is Dr. Harrison recommends that we do this for 5 minutes every day to minimize pain.&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="sectionContentSubTitle">Carlos Guillen, 10/11/2022 Negative Effects Do I agree with this list? I disagree with this list based on the fact that violence in video games and aggressive behavior don't have a connection. I play violent games such as Mortal Kombat and I don't get angry over the smallest thing. Same thing with my friends, they play Modern Warfare and I don't see them picking fights with other people at school. On a side note there are negative effects towards gaming, these being insomnia and sleep deprivation. These are caused when adrenaline levels get too high and interfere with the hormonal axis responsible for the aforementioned circadian rhythm.</p>
      <p class="sectionContent"> Yes, the article is convincing. Yes, because it says "Kids who play excessively do so up to the wee hours of the morning. This results in sleep deprivation, which is more harmful to minds that are still developing." It means that extensively playing can have a bad effect on a young one's mind. Especially if they have school the next day, it can severely affect there attention. Yes, those include "Make game time a reward".

      <h2 class="sectionContentTitle"> Relaxation</h2>
      <h3 class="sectionContentSubTitle">Carlos Guillen, 10/13/2022 Brainstorm a list of games that you can use for relaxing when you are stressed. Animal Crossing New Horizons This game Is for people who want to get the feeling of owning their own private island. They can decorate their islands in any fashion, paired with a cheerful and relaxing soundtrack. It gives out a chill and relaxing vibe. Unravel This game is primarily a puzzle game, Unravel focuses on Yarny, a tiny thread character that unravels as players travel farther in the game. It's slightly morbid but in a strangely adorable way, as players essentially use Yarny's body to navigate the harsh environments. The Legend of Zelda: Botw This game may have some stressful moments, but the basis of the game is to explore and go at your pace. You get to explore all around the map without having to face too many enemies if you know what you're doing. All the while, you can see beautiful scenery from the tall trees to the animals that live and breathe. It truly gives you a breath of the wild. Candy Crush When I began playing this over 5 years, because of the colorful explosions that glowed around the screen. I don't know why but they made me feel calmer. Since then, I started feeling happier, it made me figure out different strategies for each of the levels.</h3>
      <p class="sectionContent"> Reflection from Q and A Session What I learned is that Mr. Houston's job is to organize events, set schedules, and make time for championships. What I know is the way someone can get recommended to a team or big corporation is by grinding in the specific game and getting skilled enough and achieve a high rank so members of a team can see it and can see your potential. They usually spend about $3,000 for a PC of extremely good quality. What I learned from Mr. Suh's job is to coach players and manage their well-being. So he makes sure the players exercise well and have a nutritional diet. He also practices with them so they are ready for any high-stress situation. Without a good sleep schedule or a good diet, the players can burn out or lose a lot of energy. Because the more they play, the less they sleep and the more drained they are. One thing I took away from this is that professionals exercise 4 times a day for 30 minutes and have a comfortable sleep schedule. One thing I know is that a player must have good teammate skills, what I mean, well they have to be able to communicate with each other in any situation. </p>
