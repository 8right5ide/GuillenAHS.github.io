        Prompt: What makes video games so enticing and entertaining
        What makes video games so enticing and entertaining is how it’s a way to escape reality. After a long, hard day it’s nice to unwind, grab a controller and game. Because in the virtual world there are no rules and regulations; you can do anything, go anywhere, and most importantly be anyone.

        This article explains what makes video games so fun and how it came from tile matching to exploring the world. They describe it as a whole new world, a way to escape the harsh reality of life. Video games give gamers the tool to fulfill their wants and desires. What makes them so addicting is the endless possibilities that lay ahead of them. They can achieve anything, without the judgement of others. The feeling of escaping reality keeps gamers in their seats, holding the controller, and playing without a care in the world.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Carlos Guillen, 8/16/2022
        Prompt: Why are video games and games in general so powerful a factor in society
        Why games are so influential because they help us escape our reality. By grabbing a controller and pressing play, you can enter a world full of wonder where the rule of reality don’t matter. It can also help people who are having trouble coping with life. By grabbing a controller, they can do anything, be anyone.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Carlos Guillen, 8/18/2022
        Prompt: Why that Game
        Out of all the games I could’ve played why Clash of Clans, I picked it because it makes the player feel like they’re the leader of their own little town. And I always have a reason to come back to this game, is they can upgrade their town and earn perks that can help them reach higher tiers. What makes this game fun to play is the fact that you’re the leader, whatever you say goes. You want to mine for gold, place a gold mine down. You want to attack another village, go ahead. What makes this game unique is that it is loved all over the world because of its simple yet very interesting game features.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Carlos Guillen, 8/22/2022
        Prompt: Describe your gaming location
        Where I would normally game is in my room where I have a little area where my switch port. In that area, I put a desk with LED lights running along the bottom of the table, to make the vibe feel cool. On the desk a have a small-sized TV connected to my switch.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Carlos Guillen, 8/30/2022
        Prompt: What game I would choose
        I would choose Smash bros Ultimate for this project&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Carlos Guillen, 9/1/2022
        Prompt: How does my social media use affect how I feel
        How my social media use affects my feelings is by influencing me to feel negative emotions. By distracting me, exposing me to bullying, rumor spreading, unrealistic views of others, and peer pressure. The risks might be related to how much social media teens use.
        What conclusions can you draw from these statistics? How do they compare to your personal experience?
        While some people have different views on this subject. A large portion of people believe social media can help people, on the other hand some believe that it can poison a person's life.
        What are key takeaways from the video? How does this compare to my personal experience?
        Social media can't cause depression, just depressed people can use it.
        Snapchat has taken a better step by making photos and videos appear temporaily.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Carlos Guillen, 9/6/2022
        Prompt: What game will you pick for the coaching part and why
        For the coaching part I would pick smash bros ultimate because it is easy to figure out and be good at. What I know about this game is that it is one of the most played fighting game for esports. What I need to coach for this game is new strategies, to learn different combos for every character, and what's the best character and the worst. Do I have any experience with OBS, No it's completely new to me.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Carlos Guillen, 9/8/2022
        Prompt: Look up your game, find a person using a strategy
        The Gamer appears to not be as predictable as me, he is dodging moves that can knock him out.
        What I can do differently than him is try to dodge attacks at the right time so I won't lose a life so easily.
        I can elaborate more on what the move is and when you should use it

      <p>&nbsp;Carlos Guillen, 9/14/2022
        Prompt: What is the best move to use in smash bros and when should I use it
        The Best move to use in smash bros is IKE's Neutral Aerial. This move is performed by pressing the special attack button "b" while in mid-air. When to use it is when your opponent is directly above you or falling towards you, this ensures a knockout. When not to use it is when your opponent is next to you, because Ike's specially is heavy attacks, it might take him a short while to recover, giving the opponent a chance to attack. </p>
